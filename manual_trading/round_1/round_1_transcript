good day to all traders and teams you've
tuned in to Tropical TV and today marks
the start of a brand new trading season
hopefully you've had some time to get
familiar with your surroundings because
it is about to go down haha let's dive
right in starting today you can trade
three of the most well-known commodities
on the island first up we have
rainforest resin a beautiful product
found all around our archipelago it has
a pretty sticky uh steady value of
10,000 sea shells and it's one of our
most reliable goods next up is kelp it's
abundant in the seas that surround us
but harvesting it can be tricky in
certain conditions it's valued at 2,000
seashells per piece but beware it's
known to be a bit unpredictable and
finally we have squid ink darker than
the night sky and as mysterious as the
deepest seas this highly appreciated
commodity is also valued at 2,000
seashells and although its price can
swing a bit some say there is a pattern
to be discovered in its price
progression that's all you need to know
to start writing your very first Python
program and craft a strategy to turn
these well-known goods into your first
big profit 


to celebrate the start of a
new trading season we've invited
representatives from the surrounding
archipelos to join us for the annual
archipelago tradeoff what a joy to
welcome back our longtime friend Pam the
Penguin from the North Archipelago she's
here to trade snowballs the main
currency of her home market and ah yes
there he is our pizza loving friend from
the South Archipelago Devon the Duck
devon we're all excited to see you again
especially after the fallout from your
highly controversial pineapple toppings
act if my sources are correct the
situation has cooled off and the only
lasting consequence of your
decision-making is a hyperinflated
currency and indeed I can see you
brought whole pizzas this time instead
of single slices with pineapple of
course ah let's not start that debate
again well Devon it's great to have you
back and finally our third guest is
Benny the Bull from the West Archipelago
it's his first time participating in the
tradeoff and he has brought silicon
nuggets to trade with welcome Benny
enjoy your first visit and happy trading
this special tradeoff will only last one
round so make sure to trade with all
three visitors and try to trade your way
to some additional seashell profits
while you can that's it for today's
Tropical TV have fun collecting
seashells and hope to see you all soon.



The trading table below shows you the exchange rates from one currency to another.
For example: For every Snowball you trade for Pizzas, you will get 1,45 Pizzas in return.

| From \ To        | Snowballs | Pizza's | Silicon Nuggets | SeaShells |
|------------------|-----------|---------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Snowballs**    | 1         | 1.45    | 0.52            | 0.72      |
| **Pizza's**      | 0.7       | 1       | 0.31            | 0.48      |
| **Silicon Nuggets** | 1.95    | 3.1     | 1               | 1.49      |
| **SeaShells**    | 1.34      | 1.98    | 0.64            | 1         |


Your trading strategy
Available capital: 500.000 seashells





Trade Sequence:

Trade 1: SeaShells → Pizza’s

Rationale: The initial conversion from SeaShells to Pizza’s gives you a premium (1 S = 1.98 P). However, because Pizza’s are hyperinflated, the goal is to hold them as briefly as possible.

Action: Convert your 500,000 SeaShells into Pizza’s to catch the high initial rate.

Trade 2: Pizza’s → Snowballs

Rationale: Immediately moving out of Pizza’s is critical. By trading Pizza’s for Snowballs (using the rate of 1 Pizza = 0.7 Snowballs), you exit the hyperinflated market quickly and step into a more stable intermediary.

Action: Execute the conversion quickly to avoid any delayed devaluation that might happen in the Pizza market.

Trade 3: Snowballs → Silicon Nuggets

Rationale: With Snowballs providing a stable foothold, you now reach out to Benny’s market. Silicon Nuggets are new, and while their pricing is volatile, the exchange rate (1 Snowball = 0.52 Silicon Nuggets) suggests that you could obtain these at a “discount” relative to your stable base. This step plays on the possibility that early entrants in a nascent market might offer extra conversion value.

Action: Convert your Snowballs into Silicon Nuggets—this is where market savvy comes in. Because Benny is new, you’d want to time your order to lock in the favorable 0.52 rate before any corrections take place.

Trade 4: Silicon Nuggets → SeaShells

Rationale: Finally, you convert your Silicon Nuggets back into SeaShells. The rate here (1 Nugget = 1.49 SeaShells) is attractive and reverses the undervaluation possibly present due to the newbie status of Benny’s market. By finalizing your trade here, you secure your gains in the original currency.

Action: Convert the acquired Silicon Nuggets at 1.49 SeaShells per Nugget to complete your cycle.
